# too-many-tabs-extension
Chrome extension providing reminders of too many open tabs

Features:
- tells you how many tabs total you currently have open on Chrome
- you can set a reminder telling you to delete tabs when you reach a tab limit
- you can set a tab limit -- it will trigger a reminder to delete some tabs (it won't stop you from opening new ones though)
- you can write some quick notes in the popup (in case you have a habit of opening new tabs as notes)
- [in progress] a visualization of your tab usage (ie: chart of # tabs opened in the past month)
- [would be nice in the future] toggle immediate history --> when you open new tabs in the span of i.e. a minute, each time you open a new one, there's a little animation or something that tells you where you left off (like a little path) so you don't get sidetracked *

Made by someone with a lot of tabs


###### *(example: current tab is a writing document. Out of curiosity, you open a tab about dogs. You see a cute picture of a dog and then search up in another tab what breed of dog that is. Then you want to search up how much it costs to take care of a dog. You open up a new tab to shop for dog food. Then you remember you're hungry and you go make yourself some food. You come back to your tabs and don't remember what you were supposed to be doing.) Currently, Chrome has a 'tab search' function where you can see what tabs you accessed and when, however sometimes it can be disorganized or difficult to see your intention with those tabs. Ideally, this new feature would give you both an idea of what path you took with your tabs (Chrome history 'by group' function is similar to this but may not always be consistent) and have an option of writing a little reminder for yourself so you know what you're doing.
